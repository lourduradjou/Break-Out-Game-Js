- **Block-breaking Challenge:** Test your skills by breaking a series of blocks strategically placed within the game grid.

- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your performance with a built-in scoring system. Compete with yourself or challenge friends to beat high scores.


## How to Play:

1. **Move the Paddle:** Control the paddle's horizontal position using the left and right arrow keys.
